#### Write your implementation of testing framework and assertion. Only after completing this go forward.
testing framework is a testing fuction that lets us test multiple lines of code at the same time between the actual result and expected result, wether its an error or not, we can see all the results at the same time without the excecution getting cut, abd also we get displayed a friendly message.

assertion is basically when the same line of code is repeated multiple times by the testing framework, we write a simpler code / function library that simplifies the testing framework so that it called much more easily and testing gets easier

#### Write two tests for the following functions using test framework assertion

#### Add two number

1. Write a function that takes two input `numA` and `numB` and returns the sum of both numbers.
2. After writing the f
unction write 5 tests for above function with different values
3. Throw an error when the arguments passed in not a number.
4. Make first test fail and see if you get the result of second test.
5. If not fix it using the test framework (try...catch) we learned in the testing framework video.

#### Multiply two numbers

1. Write a function that takes two input `numA` and `numB` and returns the multiplication of both numbers.
2. After writing the function write 5 tests for above function with different values
3. Throw an error when the arguments passed in not a number.
4. Make first test fail and see if you get the result of second test.
5. If not fix it using the test framework (try...catch) we learned in the testing framework video.
